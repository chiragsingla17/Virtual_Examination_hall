41	APF stand for atomic packing fraction .it is the percentage packing fraction in a crystalline structure 	2
42	APF  is defined as the ratio of volume of the atoms in the crystal to the volume of crystal	3
43	it is defined as the ratio of volume of atom in unit cell to the volume of unit  cell	3
44	APF is defined as the total no. of atoms present upon total volume of a unit cell	1
45	it is atomic packing frequency and is defined by ratio of n. of unit cell to the total volume	3
46	APF can be defined as the total no. of atoms present upon the total volume of unit cell	1
47	it is the ratio of the volume of atom divoded by volue of unit cell	1
48	APF is defined as the atomic packing fraction it is the percentage of the packing fraction of a cube lattice structure	2
49	APF stand for atomic packing fraction .it is the percentage packing fraction in a crystalline structure 	3
50	it can be defined as the ability of crystal of having no. of atoms in it. Such as face centered . Body centered , simple cubic .	3
51	APF is efficiency that is calculated by the formula for a cubic lattice which determines the overall packing efficiency os atoms in a space lattice of acube	3
52	it is defined a the total volume of  the cubic structure with respect to the volume of cube	3
